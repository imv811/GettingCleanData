This script run_analysis.R merges the training and the test sets to create one large data set.
It then extracts only the measurements for the mean and standard deviation for each variable.
It uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
It also apropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 
Once the large dataset is crteated,  it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject.
